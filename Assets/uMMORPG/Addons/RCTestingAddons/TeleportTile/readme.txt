1). Navigate to Assets -> uMMORPG -> Addons -> RCTestingAddons -> TeleportTile -> [“2D” or “3D”] ->prefab<br>
2). Drag theTeleportTile(free) prefab to scene (or hierarchy)<br>
3). Rename as needed to keep up with warps, as to make life easier when working with multiple warps and triggers. *not required, just suggested*<br>
4). keep teleport from as small as possible, but a way where the player can barely touch it. Don’t have a teleport to location on top or to close to a teleport from location, as this may make the player teleport again.<br>
5). enjoy
